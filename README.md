# bgg-analysis
My project for CKME136 at the Chang School in Spring/Summer 2017

To initialize, run bgg_prepare.py in python (preferably version 3.6.1, 64-bit).

After initializing, write a JSON file matching the provided schema and save it to input.json, then run bgg_search.py in python. The results will appear in query_results.sqlite.
